# IDS-ML-Project
Machine Learning Intrusion Detection System using NSL-KDD dataset (LR, RF, XGBoost)

This project builds and evaluates multiple ML models on the **NSL-KDD dataset**:
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- XGBoost

## Features
- Binary classification (normal vs attack)
- Preprocessing pipeline with scaling + one-hot encoding
- Evaluation: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix
- Comparison of LR, RF, XGBoost

## Files
`IDS_NSLKDD.ipynb` — full Colab notebook
 `requirements.txt` — dependencies
